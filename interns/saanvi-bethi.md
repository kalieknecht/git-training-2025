I'm an undergraduate student from Glastonbury, Connecticut, going into my third year at Georgia Tech. I'm studying Nuclear Engineering with a Computer Science minor. My goals for the internship are to expand upon my coding skills and knowledge of neural networks, as well as learn more about radiation detection.
